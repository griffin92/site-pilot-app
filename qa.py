"""Ask-the-drawings: targeted lookup, as opposed to the deep-scan engines.

Two-stage design. A cheap text-only routing call reads the sheet index and
picks which sheets likely hold the answer; only those get rendered and sent.
On a 100-sheet set that's the difference between seconds and minutes per
question, and accuracy improves because the model isn't wading through 90
irrelevant sheets.
