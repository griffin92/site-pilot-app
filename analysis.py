"""Deep-scan engines: clash audit, takeoff, submittals, doc intel, indexing.

REWRITTEN to use structured JSON output instead of scraping 'ISSUE:' /
'TAKEOFF:' prefixes out of free text. The old approach failed silently: on a
multi-batch run the merge pass would re-word the findings and drop the
prefixes, the parser would match nothing, and the UI would show an empty
result as though the scan had found no problems. Structured output plus a
Python-side merge removes that whole failure class.
